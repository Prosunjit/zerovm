\begin{abstract}

While Openstack swift facilitates storage and management of unlimited amount of data, with conventional cloud computing paradigm, for the purpose of  processing these enormous amount of data, it is required to be moved back and forth to the computing host exhausing significant cpu cycles and resulting serious I/O bottleneck. ZeroVM, a specially designed hypervisor for the cloud, eliminates unnecessary movement of data by enabling data local computing by virtue of uniquely designed applications called ZAP (zerovm application package) which facilitates computation around data inside swift storage.  This approach can enable swift customers to have sophisticated control over their data by specifying not only who can or cannot access their data, but also how much of the content can be accessed. Inspired by the fact, we are developing a zerovm application, that let data ownser specify access policy on the content of the data file and describe who can or cannot not access which portion of the data which is essentially more fine granined access control over the ACL based all/nothing access.  The prototype of our proposal  is implemented on JSON data formatted file.
