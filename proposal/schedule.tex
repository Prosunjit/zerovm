\section{Program Schedule}
The timeline of the deliverables of our project can be broken into small pieces to make it more concrete and achievable.  Here we like to mention following phases of our project.

\subsection{Extended Proposal,}
After the submission of our initial proposal, here we are submitting an extended proposal that  specifies in more details what we want to accomplish.

\subsection{Design Phase}
In this phase (by the end of August), we expect to have a  detailed design of our implementation along with a concrete definition of the  problem and the solution. We hope, during this phase, we should be able to evaluate our proposed approach along with its pros and cons. 

\subsection{ Implementation Phase}
In this phase (by the end of  February, 2015), we expect to be able to implement our proposed solution, have an idea how to take it to the production line (if possible).We should also be able to drive business use cases for Rackspace customers for our proposed application.

\subsection{Final Phase}
In this phase (in the 2nd year), we would work on the enhancement of our prototype implementation. Currently, our proposal is Content Based Access Control for single document. During this time, we would work for multiple documents which seems more interesting and would probably meet real customer requirements.
