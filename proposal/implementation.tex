\section { Implementation}

Our implementation does not require any change in the ZeroVM project. We only require following changes in Zerocloud middleware and ZeroVM client program

\begin{enumerate}
\item Changes in the Swift request header
\item Changes in the Zerocloud middleware
\item Changes in the Swift client


\subsection{Request header}
In order to associate policy with the file and specify JSONPath as a query parameter, we need to add two request headers namely, \textbf{--cbac-policy} and \textbf{--jsonpath}.  The values of --cbac-policy header can be a separte policy file or  JSON text specifying the policies. On the otherhand, the value of --jsonpath would be a valid JSONPath. 

\subsection{Zerocloud Middleware}
In the Zerocloud middleware, along with the file to be queried we  need to capture the values of --cbac-policy ( or retrieve corresponding policy file). We may need to modify the ZeroVM manifest file to include this policy file as another valid input channel. 

\subsection{ZeroVM client}

In order to specify --cbac-policy and --jsonpath headers, we may need to modify python-swiftclient or zpm command.

\end{enumerate}
