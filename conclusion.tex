\section{Conclusion}
As more and more data is being uploaded in the cloud, these data may contain sensitive information. With existing swift API, one can either access the full content or nothing. We have presented somelegitimate situations where one should be given access to a  file with sensitive content being filtered out.  With the coupling of swift with zerovm, we are proposing here to develop an application where someone can specify policy with a file and let different user access different parts of it. Currenly, our content based access control is limited to one file, but it the future we want to implement it for multiple linked files.
