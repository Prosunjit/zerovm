\section{Conclusion}
As more and more data is being uploaded in the cloud,  data may contain sensitive information. With existing Swift API, one can either access the full content of a file or nothing. We have presented a legitimate situation where one should be given access to a  file with sensitive content being filtered out.  With the coupling of Swift with ZeroVM, we are proposing here to develop an application where someone can specify a policy with a file and let different user access different parts of it. Currenly, our solution which is a content based access control,  is limited to one document, but it the future we want to implement it for multiple linked documents.
